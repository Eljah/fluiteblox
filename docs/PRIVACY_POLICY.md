# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>_

This Privacy Policy describes how **<App Name>** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the **<App Name>** mobile application (the “App”).

## 1) Information we collect

### Audio / microphone data
The App requests access to your device microphone to analyze speech and provide real-time feedback. Audio is used **only for on-device analysis** and is **not stored or transmitted** by default.

### Device information
We do not intentionally collect device identifiers. If system logs or crash reports are enabled by the OS, they may include limited device information.

## 2) How we use information
We use microphone input solely to provide the App’s core functionality (speech analysis and feedback). We do not use audio data for advertising or profiling.

## 3) Sharing of information
We do **not** sell, trade, or share personal information with third parties. We do not transmit audio recordings to any server by default.

## 4) Data retention
We do not store microphone audio. Any transient audio data is processed in memory and discarded immediately after analysis.

## 5) Children’s privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 6) Security
We take reasonable measures to protect user data; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 7) Your choices
You can revoke microphone access at any time in your device settings. The App may not function correctly without microphone access.

## 8) Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date above and, if changes are significant, provide notice within the App or on our website.
